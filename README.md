## Project Overview
This program determines common available meeting slots for multiple participants based on their busy schedules, working periods, and a required meeting duration. The program reads input data from `input.txt`, processes it, and writes the available meeting times to `output.txt`.

## Files
- **main.py**: Contains the primary code and function definitions.
- **input.txt**: Input file for the busy schedules, working periods, and meeting duration.
- **output.txt**: Output file where available meeting slots will be saved.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Place `input.txt` in the same directory as `Project2_starter.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `Project2_starter.py`, and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python Project2_starter.py
